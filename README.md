# A History
Welcome to [Xtreme Balance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZecD8ku4FU)!

This project was born from a group project at the Digital Worlds Institute at the University of Florida back in 2017.

Retroing this project, I'd say one of the things that went best was the concept. Something that's _really_ easy to do at any experience level is overcommit, games are ***cool*** after all, and we devs always want our games to be as cool as possible!

The basic concept of Xtreme Balance hindered on a single mechanic that created fun and silly experiences, and something we learned quickly was, _even that_ was difficult to deliver in time when it came to developing the project and managing other course loads.

Keying into that simplicity was our goal. We wanted to really lean into a **cute** and **silly** experience, which my teammates did fantastically with their work in developing the UI, Character, and Background Art.

The goal here was that the 'click spammy' and short iteration loops is a game system that can engage, but also frustrate a player, which we wanted to avoid. There can be a fine line between adorable hilarity, and frustration, and dare I say we strove to find the... `balance`.
